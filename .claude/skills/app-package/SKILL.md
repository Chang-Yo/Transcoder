# App Package Skill

Packages the Transcoder Windows application for distribution.

## When to Use

Call this skill when:
- User wants to create a release build
- User wants to package the app for distribution
- User invokes `/app-package` command

## Packaging Process

### Phase 1: Pre-Build Documentation

1. **Summarize code changes**
   - Review recent commits and changes since last release
   - Present summary to user for confirmation

2. **Gather release info**
   - Ask user for version number (default: current version from Cargo.toml)
   - Confirm release summary and version before proceeding

3. **Update documentation**
   - `README.md` - update version info if needed
   - `CHANGELOG.md` - add new release entry with changes summary
   - `docs/gh-pages/` - update documentation site if applicable
   - Ask user to confirm any uncertain information

### Phase 2: Git Operations

4. **Commit changes**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Release v{version}"
   ```
   Note: Never add Claude Code to co-author list

5. **Switch to main branch and merge**
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git merge {current-branch}
   ```

6. **Create release tag**
   ```bash
   git tag v{version}
   ```

### Phase 3: Build & Package

7. **Build release binary**
   ```bash
   npm run tauri build
   ```

8. **Update dist-release folder**
   - The `dist-release/` folder already exists with `ffmpeg/` subdirectory
   - Only update these files:
     - Replace `transcoder.exe` with newly built binary from `src-tauri/target/release/`
     - Replace `README.md` if it has changed
   - The `ffmpeg/` folder and its contents remain unchanged

9. **Create zip archive**
   ```bash
   powershell -Command "Compress-Archive -Path dist-release\* -DestinationPath dist-release/transcoder-v{version}-windows.zip"
   ```

10. **Cleanup old archives**
    - Delete old zip files (e.g., `transcoder-v0.5.1-windows.zip`)
    - Keep only the newest release

11. **Verify package**
    - Check zip file size (should be 100-200 MB range)
    - Confirm all required files are included

### Phase 4: Completion

12. **Report to user**
    - Summarize what was done
    - Show zip file size
    - Ask user if they want to push to remote:
      - Push commits: `git push origin main`
      - Push tag: `git push origin v{version}`

## Output Structure

```
dist-release/
├── transcoder.exe          (5-6 MB, from release build)
├── ffmpeg/
│   ├── ffmpeg.exe          (static, unchanged)
│   └── ffprobe.exe         (static, unchanged)
├── README.md               (may be updated)
└── transcoder-v{version}-windows.zip
```

## Files Modified

- `src-tauri/Cargo.toml` - version (if changed)
- `src-tauri/tauri.conf.json` - version (if changed)
- `README.md` - documentation updates
- `CHANGELOG.md` - release notes
- `docs/gh-pages/*` - site documentation (if applicable)

## Files Created
